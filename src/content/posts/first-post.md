Hello, and welcome to my site!

I've wanted to publish a blog for years, not necessarily because I have a lot to of wisdom to impart on the world, but at least I get to learn a few things on the way. A few years back I tried to do the same with a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) site, but I had trouble getting all the features I wanted, to the effort kind of just fizzled out. Hopefully, this new site, built with [Astro](https://astro.build), will meet a kinder fate.

One lesson leaned from my aborted attempt is to not wait until everything is perfect before publishing. So I will try to polish things over time, and try to document the progress here.

So, don't be a stranger.
